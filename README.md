The idea of shopping cart came from my PHP Programming classes, which ask the student to select one of three type of projects types.

The idea of a garden ecommerce come from my own frustration with shopping at a gardening site that just plain sucks.

Class project wise, some of the basic expectations about project elements are:
* PHP MVC.
* Maintaining a session.
* Ability to log in as admin and as user with different user permissions.
* Ajax.


Some of the additional goals I have is:
* Find a way to deal with tax and shipping cost, which was one of the major frustration I had with my previous gardening shop experience.  
* Make it friendly for both desktop and mobile device.
* Avoid making a design disaster. Just cause it is a class project does not means I should throw all my design lessons to the backburner.
* Incorporate some web security techniques, particularly the ones I have been reading at OSWASP.
* If possibly, add in features that make it accessibility-friendly.

Here are some images of what the web app currently look like:
* To begin with, validation happens in both client and server. If JavaScript was turn off for some reason, validation will still occur:

* Here is the landing page for a successful regular user login:

* For the admin, there is also an inventory panel. Note that "Inventory" link will only appear on navigation bar if user have admin privilege:

* On the official inventory page, in addition to the inventory panel, there are also input submission to add or delete inventory items:

* On the cart page, incremental button was used:

* The website also have a search bar that uses Ajax. The navigation bar adjusts according to search result:
