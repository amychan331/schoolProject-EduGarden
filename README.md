The idea of shopping cart came from my PHP Programming classes, which ask the student to select one of three type of projects types.

The idea of a garden ecommerce come from my own frustration with shopping at a gardening site that just plain sucks.

Class project wise, some of the basic expectations about project elements are:
* PHP MVC.
* Maintaining a session.
* Ability to log in as admin and as user with different user permissions.
* Ajax.

Some of the additional goals I have is:
* Find a way to deal with tax and shipping cost, which was one of the major frustration I had with my previous gardening shop experience. 
* Make it friendly for both desktop and mobile device.
* Avoid making a design disaster. Just cause it is a class project does not means I should throw all my design lessons to the backburner.
* Incorporate some web security techniques, particularly the ones I have been reading at OSWAP.
* If possibly, add in features that make it accessibility-friendly.
