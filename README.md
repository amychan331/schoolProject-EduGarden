The idea of shopping cart came from my PHP Programming classes, which ask the student to select one of three type of projects types.

The idea of a garden ecommerce come from my own frustration with shopping at a gardening site that just plain sucks.

Class project wise, some of the basic expectations about project elements are:
* PHP MVC.
* Maintaining a session.
* Ability to log in as admin and as user with different user permissions.
* Ajax.
